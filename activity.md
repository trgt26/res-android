An activity represents a single screen with a user interface. It is typically used to interact with the user. Activities are crucial for building the user interface and handling user interactions.

**User Interface (UI):** An activity usually corresponds to a single screen in the app, and it defines the user interface and interactions for that screen.

**Lifecycle:** Activities have a lifecycle that includes methods such as onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(). These methods are called at different points in the activity's lifecycle, allowing developers to manage resources and handle transitions between different states.

**Intent:** Activities are typically started by sending an "intent," which is a message that describes a desired action. Intents are used to navigate between different activities within an app or even between different apps.

**Back Stack:** Activities are managed in a stack called the "back stack." When a new activity is started, it is pushed onto the stack, and when the user presses the back button, the top activity is popped off the stack.

**Communication:** Activities can communicate with each other using intents. Data can be passed between activities through extras in the intent.

**Manifest File:** Each activity must be declared in the AndroidManifest.xml file, which serves as a configuration file for the Android application.
